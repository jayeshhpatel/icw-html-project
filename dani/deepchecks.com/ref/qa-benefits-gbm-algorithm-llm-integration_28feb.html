GBM (gradient boosting machine) algorithms and LLMs (large language models) are unique and powerful algorithms that have emerged with the rise of data science and AI. <a href="https://www.deepchecks.com/glossary/lightgbm/">GBM algorithms</a> excel in analyzing structured data, while LLMs have revolutionized the understanding and generation of natural language. What happens when they are combined?

Integrating both technologies bridges the gap between structured and unstructured data processing. For example, in e-commerce, GBMs analyze user behavior while LLMs interpret product reviews, creating an overall recommendation engine. Let us discuss how combining GBMs and <a href="https://www.deepchecks.com/glossary/llm-parameters/">LLMs</a> can deliver more robust, interpretable, and scalable solutions.
<h2>GBM Algorithm and LLMs</h2>
Boosting algorithms are from the family of ensemble learning techniques. Some popular boosting algorithms are AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting), LightGBM, and CatBoost.

Ensemble learning is a technique where predictions from multiple base models are combined to create a single accurate prediction model. Each model is trained sequentially, and the subsequent model corrects the mistakes from the previous model. Then, the final outputs are combined for the final prediction using a technique such as weighted voting.

Of the algorithms mentioned above, the gradient boosting algorithm is among the most efficient algorithms for working with database tables.

<strong>GBMs have the following benefits:</strong>

Higher predictive accuracy: Multiple decision trees are aggregated to minimize the prediction errors.
Able to handle multiple data types: GBMs easily process numeric, categorical, and missing values.
Analyzing feature importance: Identifying the impactful features contributing most to the predictions.

The following <a href="https://pythongeeks.org/gradient-boosting-algorithm-in-machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image</a> represents how GBM works.

LLMs, on the other hand, engage with unstructured data. They understand the human language, the context, sentiment, and intended meaning to a certain level and then generate responses accordingly.
<h2>Benefits of integration</h2>
With the integration of these two <a href="https://www.deepchecks.com/question/how-can-data-normalization-and-scaling-affect-machine-learning-algorithms/">influential algorithms</a>, we can obtain the following benefits:
<h3>Better Predictions</h3>
Improved accuracy paves the way for better predictions. As mentioned earlier, combining GBMs with LLMs provides more room for accurate predictions by leveraging structured and unstructured data.

For example, in a financial institution, a model is used to predict loans using a GBM algorithm, and another model is used to interpret loan applications. By combining these two models that engage with structured and textual data, a predictive system can be created for enhanced performance.
<h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
LLMs are capable of generating the numerical representation of textual data, which can be added as a feature to GBMs as they are excellent at identifying patterns. For example, in a product review analysis use case, LLMs create embeddings from the review, and GBM uses those embeddings plus other data to predict sales trends.
<h3>Enhanced Interpretability</h3>
LLM is a natural black box, which makes it difficult to understand how it arrives at predictions. Integrating LLM embeddings into GBMs makes it more interpretable. The combined model is more transparent and can increase trust in AI systems.
<h2>Applications across domains</h2>
There are multiple domains where there is a need to enable AI systems to leverage structured and unstructured data, like healthcare for merging patient records with clinical data, finance for analyzing the numerical with textual data, and E-commerce to improve recommendations using reviews and clickstream data.
<h2>Challenges and considerations</h2>
<h3>Computational Complexity</h3>
LLMs need massive computational power, memory, and time, making them resource-intensive. Combining LLMs with GBMs adds extra steps, increasing the overall complexity.
<h3>Integration and overfitting risks</h3>
Integration needs a great engineering flow design to create the pipelines. A single missed step can degrade the performance. Generalization is applied to model complexity, as there is a higher chance of overfitting with smaller datasets.

To get rid of the following challenges, we can use a pretrained LLM, which reduces the computational overhead, use libraries/hybrid work frames designed for multi-model integration, etc.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
New frameworks and tools will evolve to simplify these integrations. Unified pipelines already support multiple models, pre-trained embeddings, and AutoML integrations. More findings on these will lower the barrier for companies to enter the AI field and generate industry-specific solutions in real time.

The integration of the GBM and LLMs undoubtedly allows for better predictions with sophisticated feature engineering and enhanced predictability.
