Ray</h2><div><p>Ray is an open-source unified compute framework allowing users to scale their AI and Python workloads quickly without needing complex infrastructures. It is a flexible Python-native distributed computing framework that allows existing AI and Python applications to be easily parallelized on a laptop and scaled to a cluster on the cloud or on-premises with no code changes. Ray includes the Ray AI Runtime (AIR), which is a native set of best-in-class scalable ML libraries that enable scaling of the most compute-intensive ML workloads such as ML data pre-processing tasks via Ray Data, training large models via Ray Train, hyperparameter tuning via Ray Tune, reinforcement learning via Ray RLlib, batch inference via Ray Batch Predictor, and real-time inference via Ray Serve. Ray’s seamless integration with the Python and ML ecosystem allows non-experts to utilize distributed computing with simple Python APIs and familiar tools. Handling distributed execution aspects like task scheduling, auto-scaling, and fault tolerance, Ray lets engineers and researchers concentrate on application logic rather than distributed system operations.&nbsp; Its ability to run code on both laptops and clusters improves developer productivity and iteration speed.</p>
<p><strong>Unique Capabilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalable:</strong> Ray offers parallel and distributed execution primitives, enabling developers to scale AI and Python applications with minimal code changes using Pythonic APIs.</li>
