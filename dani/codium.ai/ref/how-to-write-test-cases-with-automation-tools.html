<h2>Example: Testing Login Functionality of a Web App</h2>
We'll write test cases for the login feature using the Selenium WebDriver automation tool in Python. Before running the code, we should have installed Selenium WebDriver and our browser's appropriate web drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver).

<b>Step 1:</b> Setup the WebDriver by importing the required libraries.
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="python">from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time


driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.maximize_window()</pre>
<b>Step 2:</b> Define test case scenarios and test data.
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">valid_username = "testuser123"
valid_password = "Test@123"
invalid_username = "invaliduser"
invalid_password = "invalidpassword"


test_scenarios = [
    {"username": valid_username, "password": valid_password, "expected_result": "success"},
    {"username": invalid_username, "password": valid_password, "expected_result": "failure"},
    {"username": valid_username, "password": invalid_password, "expected_result": "failure"},
    {"username": invalid_username, "password": invalid_password, "expected_result": "failure"},
]</pre>
<b>Step 3:</b> Write the test case function to execute the login test cases.
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">def test_login(username, password, expected_result):
    driver.get("https://example.com/login")
    username_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "username")
    password_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "password")
    login_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[contains(text(), 'Login')]")


    username_input.clear()
    username_input.send_keys(username)


    password_input.clear()
    password_input.send_keys(password)


    login_button.click()


    time.sleep(2)


    if expected_result == "success":
        welcome_message = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//h1[contains(text(), 'Welcome')]")
        assert welcome_message.is_displayed(), "Login failed. Welcome message not displayed."
    elif expected_result == "failure":
        error_message = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//div[@class='error-message']")
        assert error_message.is_displayed(), "Expected error message not displayed."


    time.sleep(2)</pre>
<b>Step 4:</b> Execute the test cases.
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">for scenario in test_scenarios:
    username = scenario["username"]
    password = scenario["password"]
    expected_result = scenario["expected_result"]
    print(f"Testing login with username: {username}, password: {password}")
    test_login(username, password, expected_result)


driver.quit()</pre>
In this example, four test scenarios are defined, each involving different combinations of valid and invalid usernames and passwords. The test_login function inputs the username, password, and expected result and performs the login operation using Selenium WebDriver. It then checks whether the login was successful based on the desired result.
