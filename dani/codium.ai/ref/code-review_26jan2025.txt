<h2>What is Exactly a Code Review?</h2>
A Code Review is a collaborative process where developers review code changes made by their team members to ensure quality, functionality, and adherence to project standards. This process ensures team collaboration, reduces bugs, and improves maintainability.

After a developer completes a code change like a new feature or a bug fix, they usually create a Pull Request to merge their changes into the main repository. This is the starting step of the code review process. Then, one or more other developers will get assigned to that PR as reviewers, who need to analyse the code and provide feedback to improve the code before the PR is merged into the target branch.

Code reviews can be conducted by peers at similar experience levels or by more experienced team members. This inclusivity builds a collaborative environment and encourages knowledge-sharing within the team.

Typically, a code review comprises the following checks:
<ul>
 	<li>Business logic verification</li>
 	<li>Code quality</li>
 	<li>Security hotspots</li>
 	<li>Performance optimizations</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is an AI Code Review?</h2>
AI code reviews offer a modern alternative to traditional code reviews by automating the analysis part. During an AI code review, instead of the project lead or the senior developer, it uses AI-powered tools trained in programming languages, best practices, and coding patterns.

This automation addresses critical aspects of code reviews, such as:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Ensuring quality and consistency:</strong> AI tools enforce coding standards, flagging inconsistencies or violations.</li>
 	<li><strong>Early bug and vulnerability detection:</strong> AI identifies issues like unused variables, security hotspots, and inefficient logic.</li>
 	<li><strong>Performance optimization:</strong> AI analyzes the code for bottlenecks and offers recommendations to improve efficiency.</li>
 	<li><strong>Knowledge sharing:</strong> AI tools provide detailed explanations and actionable insights, making feedback accessible to everyone on the team.</li>
</ul>
However, AI tools may struggle to fully grasp the intent or context behind specific implementations, causing irrelevant or incorrect suggestions. Hence, a developer should always overlook this process to interpret and apply AI-generated feedback appropriately.
<h2>Why are Code Reviews Important?</h2>
Code reviews are critical for maintaining high-quality, secure, and maintainable software. Here are some of the key reasons why a code review is important:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Catch critical errors early:</strong> Developers can identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and inefficiencies before merging. This reduces production risks and minimizes technical debt.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ensure compliance with guidelines:</strong> Code reviews ensure adherence to coding standards, team policies, and regulatory requirements. This is especially important in industries like healthcare and finance.</li>
 	<li><strong>Foster informed decision-making:</strong> Reviews provide a forum for discussing trade-offs made under constraints like deadlines. This ensures better alignment on long-term impacts.</li>
 	<li><strong>Encourage collaboration and accountability:</strong> By involving team members in the review process, code reviews build a culture where developers take shared responsibility for the quality of the codebase.</li>
 	<li><strong>Promote team knowledge sharing:</strong> Through reviewing each other’s work, team members gain a deeper understanding of different parts of the system and reduce dependency on specific individuals.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Top Benefits of Code Reviews</h2>
Code reviews provide numerous benefits that improve the quality of software and enhance team efficiency. These include:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Improved code quality:</strong> Ensures that all code meets project requirements, follows best practices, and integrates seamlessly with existing functionality.</li>
 	<li><strong>Early issue detection:</strong> Prevents costly fixes later by identifying and resolving bugs, inefficiencies, and vulnerabilities during development.</li>
 	<li><strong>Enhanced collaboration:</strong> Encourages team members to share knowledge, exchange ideas, and improve their understanding of the codebase through constructive feedback.</li>
 	<li><strong>Consistency in coding standards:</strong> Enforces a unified style across the project, making the codebase easier to read, debug, and maintain over time.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reduced long-term maintenance costs:</strong> Addressing issues early helps prevent the accumulation of technical debt, reducing future maintenance overhead.</li>
 	<li><strong>Increased security:</strong> Identifies potential vulnerabilities proactively, strengthening the application’s security posture and protecting end users.</li>
 	<li><strong>Continuous skill development:</strong> Provides developers with actionable feedback to enhance their technical skills, fostering growth across the team.</li>
</ol>
Modern code review platforms amplify these benefits by combining automation with predefined review checklists, allowing human reviewers to focus on logic, architecture, and domain-specific issues.
<h2>4 Common Code Review Approaches</h2>
There are several ways in which teams conduct code reviews. These approaches can vary based on team size, project complexity, and workflow preferences. Here are four common approaches used in software development:
<h3>1. Over-the-shoulder reviews</h3>
This informal approach involves a developer sitting next to a colleague and explaining their code. The reviewer provides immediate feedback, fostering direct communication and quick issue resolution. While effective for small teams or minor changes, this approach lacks documentation and doesn’t scale well for larger teams.
<h3>2. Pair programming</h3>
In pair programming, two developers work together on the same code in real time. One developer writes the code (the driver) while another reviews it (the observer).

This collaborative approach ensures immediate feedback, encourages knowledge sharing, and reduces errors. However, it can be resource-intensive and is better suited for critical or complex tasks.
<h3>3. Tool-assisted code reviews</h3>
You can leverage automated code review tools like <a href="https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SonarCloud</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT</a>, and <a href="https://www.qodo.ai/">Qodo</a> to improve the overall code review process. It integrates with tools like BitBucket or GitHub, as well as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, enabling real-time automated checks. This integration ensures faster feedback loops and maintains code quality throughout the development lifecycle, reducing manual effort for routine checks.

Automated systems can scan for common issues such as performance bottlenecks, security hotspots, and code smells, providing developers with actionable insights before merging changes into the main branch.
<h3>4. Formal code reviews</h3>
A formal code review is a structured and rigorous process in which multiple reviewers examine the code against a predefined checklist. The findings are often discussed in meetings, which often result in detailed reports.

This approach is highly effective for ensuring quality in critical systems but can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>How does AI code review work?</h3>
AI code reviews leverage artificial intelligence to analyze, assess, and provide feedback on code automatically. There are six components to an AI Code Review:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Static code analysis:</strong> The AI tool examines the code without executing it, identifying issues such as syntax errors, unused variables, or inconsistent formatting. These tools analyze the structure, logic, and organization of the code.</li>
