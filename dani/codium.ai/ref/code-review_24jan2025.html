<h2>What is Exactly a Code Review?</h2>
A code review is a collaborative process in which a project lead or a senior developer evaluates the code written by a developer on their team. This process usually happens after a developer creates a pull request to merge his changes into the main repository after completing a feature or bug fix.

Typically, a code review comprises the following checks:
<ul>
 	<li>Business logic verification</li>
 	<li>Code quality</li>
 	<li>Security hotspots</li>
 	<li>Performance optimizations</li>
</ul>
Out of these, code quality, security hotspots, and performance analyses are conducted via automated code reviews. For example, many companies integrate tools like <a href="https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SonarCloud</a>, <a href="https://snyk.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snyk</a>, and <a href="https://www.qodo.ai/">Qodo</a> into their development workflow as they automatically review and comment on your pull requests if there are bugs, security hotspots, or code smells. This reduces the overall effort from the reviewer so they can focus on testing the actual business logic to verify that the application works as expected.
<h2>What is an AI Code Review?</h2>
An AI code review is similar to a traditional code review. Instead of the project lead or the senior developer, it uses AI-powered tools trained in programming languages, best practices, and coding patterns to analyze code quality.

For instance, models like <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/code-review-gpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT</a> perform exceptionally well in understanding your codebase, detecting potential issues, and suggesting improvements tailored to your team’s coding style. Thus, the review feels similar to one conducted by an actual human.

Additionally, AI code reviews let you automate routine tasks like enforcing consistent variable naming, ensuring modularity, and identifying duplicate code, significantly reducing human errors and improving overall code quality.
<h2>Why are Code Reviews Important?</h2>
Code reviews are an essential step in software development, as they ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability. They are a collaborative effort in which team members review each other’s code for bugs, design issues, or performance issues before it is merged with the main codebase. Many teams now use code review platforms to streamline this process, enabling faster feedback and automated checks.

Some of the key reasons why a code review is important are:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Error detection:</strong> Developers can identify bugs, security vulnerabilities, or inefficiencies that might have been overlooked. Catching these issues before it is merged into the main repository reduces the risk of problems in production while minimizing technical debt.</li>
 	<li><strong>Knowledge sharing:</strong> Team members gain a deeper understanding of different parts of the system, improving collaboration and reducing dependency on specific individuals.</li>
 	<li><strong>Enforce coding standards:</strong> Reviews ensure that your codebase conforms to established guidelines, improving readability and consistency. Code review platforms often enforce these standards automatically, saving time and effort.</li>
 	<li><strong>Enhance team accountability:</strong> Reviewing code allows you to hold your team accountable. You know what you merge into the central repository and can identify who brings which changes. So, if a new feature has an issue, you can easily fix it, as you know who to talk to.</li>
 	<li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Constructive feedback helps developers improve and progress gradually, leading to a more competent team and higher-quality software.</li>
 	<li><strong>Understand tradeoffs:</strong> Sometimes code is written while trading off certain things. For example, you might be working on a feature with an extremely tight deadline. In such cases, you might not be able to write clean code but rather focus on meeting your target. For such examples, code reviews help have in-depth discussions on why such decisions were made.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Top Benefits of Code Reviews</h2>
Code reviews are an important practice in software development. They offer several benefits that improve code quality, enhance team collaboration, and ensure project success. Here are some of the top benefits of conducting code reviews:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Improved code quality:</strong> Code reviews make sure that the code is up to industry requirements and requirements for the project. Reviewers can find bugs, logical errors, and inefficient work that would not have been captured during development. This results in cleaner, more robust, and maintainable code.</li>
 	<li><strong>Detect issues earlier:</strong> By identifying bugs, vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks early, code reviews help prevent costly fixes later in the development lifecycle. This reduces the likelihood of critical failures in production.</li>
 	<li><strong>Knowledge sharing and collaboration:</strong> Code reviews encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members. They expose developers to coding skills and parts of the code base they have never worked on, cumulatively broadening the team's knowledge and minimizing knowledge gaps.</li>
 	<li><strong>Enhanced code consistency:</strong> Code reviews enforce adherence to coding standards and best practices, ensuring consistency across the project. Uniform coding styles make the codebase easier to understand, debug, and maintain.</li>
 	<li><strong>Increased accountability:</strong> Knowing their work will be evaluated makes developers strive to write better-quality code. This sense of accountability boosts overall productivity and instills a culture of responsibility within the team.</li>
 	<li><strong>Improved security:</strong> Code reviews can help you identify potential security vulnerabilities, such as improper data handling or insufficient authentication. Addressing these early strengthens the application’s security posture.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reduced technical debt:</strong> By catching flaws early and enforcing standards, code reviews minimize the accumulation of technical debt. This reduces the long-term cost of maintaining and upgrading the codebase.</li>
 	<li><strong>Continuous learning and skill development:</strong> Constructive feedback during code reviews helps developers learn from their mistakes and improve their skills over time, leading to a more capable and effective team.</li>
</ol>
Modern code review platforms enhance these benefits further by combining code review automation with predefined code review checklists. This not only speeds up reviews but also reduces human oversight errors. Automated systems ensure that all critical checks, from formatting rules to performance guidelines, are consistently applied, leaving human reviewers free to focus on logic, architecture, and domain-specific issues.
<h2>4 Common Code Review Approaches</h2>
There are several ways in which teams conduct code reviews. These approaches can vary based on team size, project complexity, and workflow preferences. Here are four common approaches used in software development:
<h3>1. Over-the-shoulder reviews</h3>
This informal approach involves a developer sitting next to a colleague and explaining their code. The reviewer provides immediate feedback, fostering direct communication and quick issue resolution.

This approach is effective for small teams or minor changes but lacks documentation. As your team grows, you won’t be able to scale this, as everyone will find it difficult to understand the code review process in your organization.
<h3>2. Pair programming</h3>
In pair programming, two developers work together on the same code in real time. One developer writes the code (the driver) while another reviews it (the observer).

This collaborative approach ensures immediate feedback, encourages knowledge sharing, and reduces errors. However, it can be resource-intensive and is better suited for critical or complex tasks.
<h3>3. Tool-assisted code reviews</h3>
You can leverage automated code review tools like <a href="https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SonarCloud</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT</a>, and <a href="https://www.qodo.ai/">Qodo</a> to improve the overall code review process. It integrates with tools like BitBucket or GitHub, scans the code in real-time, and provides immediate feedback to the developer on everyday programming concerns like:
<ol>
 	<li>Performance issues</li>
 	<li>Security hotspots</li>
 	<li>Code smells.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Formal code reviews</h3>
A formal code review is a structured and rigorous process in which multiple reviewers examine the code against a predefined checklist. The findings are often discussed in meetings, which often result in detailed reports.

This approach is highly effective for ensuring quality in critical systems but can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
