                                    <p>The Ending Agricultural Trade Suppression (EATS) Act, (S.2019 and H.R.4417), introduced by Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS) and Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA), aims to strip state and local governments of their ability to make agricultural policies within their own borders — policies that create market opportunity and protect communities' health and wellbeing.</p>
                                    <p>The EATS Act is a power grab by a handful of global agribusinesses to the detriment of farmers, our land and water, our health, animals, consumers, and local governments. It would cripple states' rights while furthering corporations' power to squeeze U.S. farms and put our people’s safety at risk.</p>

                                <p>By eliminating these opportunities, the act will accelerate market concentration in the food and agriculture industries, giving multinational corporations the win over American farmers and ranchers.</p>

But over 1,000 state and local laws would be stripped from the books if the EATS Act is passed. The act would allow giant corporations to file lawsuits across the country against state and local governments. This attacks the vital U.S. principle that gives states the power to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens within their borders.</p>
                                <p>The EATS Act would have a devastating impact on local governments as they could risk bankruptcy while fighting endless litigation to defend their laws.</p>
